# Scrape Definitions and Conjugations
Given a list of words, scrape the definitions and conjugations from Merriam Webster and Collins Dictionary.  For my AP Literature homework.  Teacher told us to copy and paste defintions and conjugations from a dictionary of our choice anyway, so just made a program to do it.  Program does not create an original sentence for you, you have to do that yourself.

## Requirements
Python, selenium, tqdm, geckodriver.

## Usage
Edit config.py with the path of your geckodriver and edit some of the other options if you desire.
